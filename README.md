# CloudFlareDns

Simple .NET Console program that update the records of your website on Cloudflare (very good for cache, security etc.)

- Setup the DNS of your domain name to CloudFlare DNS
- Edit the json config file to run it once (manually or windows task if on windows) and/or set a timer interval to check and update the public ip of the web server on CloudFlare
